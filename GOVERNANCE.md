# Governance — HormigasAIS Nodo-Escuela

## Purpose
This document defines the governance, authority boundaries,
and decision model for the HormigasAIS Nodo-Escuela repository.

Nodo-Escuela is a **non-executable, educational and documentary node**
within the HormigasAIS ecosystem.

---

## Execution Policy Reference

Nodo-Escuela adheres to an explicit execution policy that defines
three operational contexts:

- **LOCAL**
- **OFFLINE**
- **EDUCATIONAL**

Under this policy:

- GitHub is **never** considered an execution environment.
- No script, agent, or autonomous logic is executed from this repository.
- All executable logic exists exclusively outside GitHub.

This repository contains **documentation, explanations, and declarations only**.

---

## Capa 4 — Execution Authority

Although this repository enforces standard GitHub protections
(branch protection, pull requests, no direct execution),
**execution authority does not reside in GitHub**.

All decisions that may result in a change to this repository are:

- Initiated by a human operator (LBH-MASTER)
- Authorized in a sovereign environment external to GitHub
- Subject to human presence, identity, and contextual validation

GitHub functions solely as:
- A publication layer
- A versioned audit record
- A collaborative documentation surface

GitHub is **not** an authority, authenticator, or executor.

---

## Decision Model

All decisions within Nodo-Escuela follow this model:

- Human-led
- Protocol-constrained
- Audit-aware
- Non-autonomous

No automated agent is permitted to approve, merge,
or execute changes in this repository.

---

## Separation Principle

HormigasAIS enforces strict separation between:

- **Training**
- **Execution**
- **Publication**

Nodo-Escuela belongs exclusively to the **publication and education layer**.

---

## Authority Statement

This repository is governed by HormigasAIS.

No external platform supersedes the internal governance,
execution authority, or decision sovereignty of the system.
